# GitOps Repository Simulation

This directory simulates a Git repository structure for GitOps workflows.

## Structure

- `helm-charts/` - Contains Helm chart source code
- `applications/` - Contains ArgoCD Application manifests

## Usage

This is a simulation directory created for demonstration purposes. In a real GitOps setup:

1. This would be a Git repository
2. ArgoCD would monitor this repository for changes
3. Changes would trigger automatic deployments
4. The repository would contain the source of truth for all deployments

## Note

This directory is created as part of the Helm GitOps deployment guide demonstration.
